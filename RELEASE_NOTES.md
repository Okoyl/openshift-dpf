# Release Notes

## Environment Variable Management Improvements

### Overview
This release introduces a new approach to environment variable management in the DPF project. The changes improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and provide a more consistent way to handle configuration across all scripts.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Centralized Environment Configuration
- Created a new `.env` file that contains all environment variables with their default values
- Organized variables into logical sections with clear comments
- Removed redundant variable definitions from the Makefile

#### 2. New Environment Loading Script
- Added `scripts/env.sh` to handle environment variable loading
- Implemented robust error handling for missing `.env` file
- Added support for comments and empty lines in the `.env` file
- Properly handles quoted values in the environment file

#### 3. Simplified Makefile
- Removed all environment variable definitions from the Makefile
- Maintained the `include .env` directive to ensure Make has access to variables
- Kept all targets and help documentation intact

#### 4. Updated Script Structure
- Modified scripts to source the environment variables from `env.sh`
- Used `$(dirname "$0")/env.sh` to ensure scripts can find the environment file regardless of where they're called from
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing script functionality

### Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Environment variables are now defined in a single location
2. **Better Organization**: Variables are grouped by functionality with clear comments
3. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Scripts can source environment variables when needed
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant variable definitions
5. **Consistent Configuration**: All scripts now use the same environment loading mechanism

### Usage

To use the new environment variable system in your scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Exit on error
set -e

# Source environment variables
source "$(dirname "$0")/env.sh"

# Your script logic here
```

### Migration Notes

No migration steps are required for existing scripts. The changes are backward compatible, and all existing functionality continues to work as before.

### Known Issues

None.

### Future Improvements

- Consider adding validation for required environment variables
- Add support for environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`)
- Implement a mechanism to override environment variables via command-line arguments
